## Project Title: Advanced Intraday strategies
### **Brief Description**: 
We aim to explore multi-market and trading sessions for intra-day trading opportunities.  More specifically, we want to create a workflow to be able to detect regimes of the market (for example, trending vs. non-trending) and then apply relevant strategies (for example, mean reversion vs. momentum) based on the regime detection results.
### **Solution**
We have coded multiple python modules and jupyter notebooks to implement possible solutions of intraday trading strategies. In this work we have focused on oscillators and momentum techniques, regime detection was also applied.
### **Key Features and Related Notebooks**
1. We have done exploratory work which should be visible (link in below section) and bit self explanatory.
We cover Bollinger Bands, Average True Range(ATR), Keltner channel and MACD in the following notebook:

2. We cover Oscillators (tuning on training data and using on testing data) in the following notebook:

3. Seasonality is covered in the following notebook:

4. RSI, EMa and Z-score analysis is covered in the following notebook:
https://github.com/laughingbud/capstone/blob/main/Yanqing-RSI%2CEMA%2CZ.ipynb
5. The explanatory research is covered in this md file:

### **Execution**
To upload the git folder please use the following bash command:

git clone https://github.com/laughing-bud/capstone.git
(please be patient it can take some time)

All the files can be executed in the Google colab, to do this please upload the file in your Google colab and run all the cells.

In the addition the requirements.txt file is provided, but we strongly recommend to use Google colab as all the libraries should be installed there.
