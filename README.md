### Project Title: Advanced Intraday strategies

### **Brief Description**: 
We aim to explore multi-market and trading sessions for intra-day trading opportunities.  More specifically, we want to create a workflow to be able to detect regimes of the market (for example, trending vs. non-trending) and then apply relevant strategies (for example, mean reversion vs. momentum) based on the regime detection results.

### **Installation**: 
!pip install git+https://github.com/laughing-bud/capstone.git

### **Usage**:
The jupyter notebook is currently work in progress. We have done exploratory work which should be visible and bit self explanatory.
